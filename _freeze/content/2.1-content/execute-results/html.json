To model them, we blend elements of monopoly with elements of perfect competition. In the short-run, we model the firm as a monopoly acting like any monopolist would, but in the long run, there is free entry and exit, so other entrants reduce the demand for any one firm’s product (and make it more elastic) so that firms’ economic profits go to zero.\n\nWe finally start oligopoly, where there are a small number of firms with market power that interact strategically. While some industries in the real world are indeed dominated by a small number of firms, this type of model is applicable well beyond industries with a small number of firms, as to understand the strategic nature of firm decisions, we introduce game theory into our models.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fas fa-book\"></i> Ch. 11.1-11.2, 7 in [Church & Ware, 2000](https://works.bepress.com/jeffrey_church/23/)\n\nChapter 11 covers product differentiation models more fully than we will cover in this course (e.g. Address models, Hotelling model, etc.). We will briefly cover the basics of monopolistic competition but then focus the rest of the semester on Oligopoly. \n\nChapter 7 covers the basics of static game theory. For now, we will only need basic concepts like Nash Equilibrium.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats.
