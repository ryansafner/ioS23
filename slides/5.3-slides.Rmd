- 1978 *Paradox of Antitrust*

- Antitrust law and enforcement consists of a conflict of interests:
  1. Consumer welfare
  2. Protectionism for small businesses

- Antitrust law protects some businesses by restraining competition
  - restraining largest businesses because they are "too big"
  - might be that they are the most efficienct!

- Some practices (overt collusion or cartelization) clearly hurt consumers: price-fixing, geographic market division, mergers that create monopolies

- But many seemingly anti-competitive practices are pro-competitive and benefit consumers:
  - price discrimination, tying, bundling, vertical contractual restraints, etc.
  - think of lectures 3.3, 3.4 for pro-competitive, efficiency reasons for these practices

> "For much too long a time students of the history of antitrust policy have been at least midly perplexed by the coolness with which American economists greeted the Sherman Act. Was not the nineteenth century the period in which the benevolent effects of competition were most widely extolled? Should not a profession praise a Congress which seeks to legislate its textbook assumptions into practice? And with even modest foresight, should not the economists have foreseen that the Sherman Act would put more into economists' purses than perhaps any other law ever passed?," (1).

# "New Learning" in Industrial Organization

.smallest[
> "A clue to a more satisfactory explanation may be found in the 'new learning' of industrial organization. Much of this learning doubts that antitrust law promotes competition. Brozen (1982, 14) for example, concludes that antitrust laws ' are themselves restraining output and the growth of productivty.' Harold Demsetz has said that if certain policies were continued, he would favor outright repeal of the Sherman Act...MsGee (1971,16) for example says, ' for a variety of reasons, it is simply *not* correct to assume that atomistic competition is the ultimate *policy* goal; or to regard departures from that kind of competition as necessarily bad."...Johnson (1983,3) writes '...the competitive model of economic theory not only offers littled guidance [for antitrust law], but actually points us in the wrong direction. The confusion arises because many economists fail to realize that the 'competitive model' is silent on the subject of competition,' (DiLorezno and High, 1988: 424)

# Economists Were Skeptical of the Sherman Act

> "There is no doubt that economists at the turn of the [20th] century looked upon competition as a process of enterprise and rivalry [rather than the 'perfect competition model'], and that they disapproved of antitrust law...If our thesis is correct, economists owe special attention to the meaning they attach to competition...[i]f these conclusions [based on perfect competition] are substantially different from conclusions based on rivalry, then the competitive model has very likely misdirected the profession, at least as far as antitrust policy is concernced" (p.432-433).

# The Standard Oil Case

> "The *Standard Oil* case of 1911 is a landmark in the development of antitrust law. But it is more than a famous law case: it created a legend. The firm whose history it relates to became the archetype of predatory monopoly," (p.137)

> "According to most accounts, the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey established an oil refining monopoly in the United States, in large part through the systematic use of predatory price discrimination. Standard struck down its competitors, in one market at a time, until it enjoyed a monopoly position everywhere. Similarly, it preserved its monopoly by cutting prices selectively wherever competitors dared enter...The main trouble with this 'history' is that it is logically deficient, and I can find little or no evidence to support it," (p.138).

The graph...shows the industries for which data on output from 1880 to 1900 are available...of the 17 industries, there were *increases* in output...in all but two industries, matches and castor oil...In addition, output in these industries generally expanded more rapidly than output in other industries during the 10 years leading up to the first trust-busting legislation," (p.35).

# Changes in Price Under the Pre-Sherman Act "Trusts"

> "And predictably, prices in these industries were generally *falling*, not rising, even when compared to the declining general price level. For example, the average price of steel rails fell from $58 to $32 between 1880 and 1890, or by 53 percent. The price of refined sugar fell from 9 cents per pound in 1880 to 7 cents in 1890 and to 4.5 cents in 1900; the price oflead dropped from $5.04 per pound in 1880 to $4.41 in 1890; and zinc fell from $5.51 per pound to $4.40...Perhaps the most widely attacked trusts were those in the sugar and petroleum industries. But there is evidence that the effect of these combinations or mergers was to *reduce* the prices of sugar and petroleum," (pp.35-36)

# Antitrust As Rent-Seeking

> "The political impetus for some kind of antitrust law came from the farm lobbies of mostly midwestern, agricultural states, such as Missouri. Rural cattlemen and butchers were especially eager to have statutes enacted that would thwart competition from the newly centralized meat processing facilities in Chicago. The evidence on price and output in these industries, moreover, does not support the conjecture that these industries suffered from a monopoly in the late nineteenth century, if monopoly is understood in the conventional neoclassical way as an organization of industry which tends to restrict output and raise prices. These industries were fiercely competitive because of relatively free entry and rapid technological advances such as refrigeration," (p.93)

 "[B]ecause of their inability to maintain their cartels [prior to the ICC], railroads were big supporters of the [Interstate Commerce Act] because the newly-formed ICC could coordinate cartel prices...Using the new law as authority, the railroads revamped their freight classification, raised rates, eliminated passes and fare reductions, and revised less than carload rates on all types of goods, including groceries."

# The Legislative History & Intent of Sherman Act

- Bork argues Sherman Act was deliberately created to promote economic efficiency

- Stigler: “I like the Sherman Act. So far as I can tell, it's a public interest law — in the same sense in which I think having private property, enforcement of contracts, and suppression of crime are public interest phenomena,” (1984, 46).


Economists have singled out the Sherman Antitrust Act as a uniquely proconsumer piece of legislation. (Hazlett 263)

This proconsumer view of antitrust is all the more ironic in light of recent dissatisfaction with anticonsumer consequences of antitrust policy generally. (See Gold- schmid et al. [1974]; Demsetz [1978]; Baxter [19801; Brozen 1982]; Armentano (1982]; Johnson [1983]; Baumol and Ordover [1985]; Hazlett 1986]; Bittlingmayer [1992]). There is widespread concern that antitrust law has been employed against competitive market rivalry. Moreover, the central paradox of an 1890 antimonopoly law remains: Why should an economy rapidly expanding outputs in virtually all major industrial sectors move to quash restrictions of output (Baxter [1980], DiLorenzo [1985]), particularly when such output increases were intrinsically tied to the emergence of large corporate forms (Chandler [1977])? 263-264

The proconsumer view of the Sherman Act has been most thoroughly elaborated
by Robert Bork, who writes: "The legislative history of the Sherman Act displays the clear and exclusive policy intention of promoting consumer welfare" [1978, 61].

264

"It is impossible to find even colorable language suggesting most of the other broad social or political purposes that have occasionally been suggested as relevant to the application of the Sherman Act" (Bork [1966,42]).

The law, argues Bork, should be interpreted as wholly devoted to maximizing economic efficiency, for even though "The legislators did not, of course, speak of consumer welfare with the precision of a modern economist, their meaning was unmistakable" [1966, 10]. And, more inclusively: "Congress' position with respect to efficiency cannot be explained on any hypothesis other than that the consumer welfare was in all cases the controlling
value under the Sherman Act" [1966, 26].

The policy importance of this interpretation is vast. Antitrust courts have repeatedly found various "noneconomic" grounds for preserving particular firms or market forms, the classic being Justice Peckham's concern over the "small dealers and worthy men" (U.S. v. Trans Missouri, [1897]) who deserved a judicial reprieve from competitive extinction. This line of reasoning forms the basis of the protectionist thrust in antitrust law. In his famous Alcoa decision, Judge Learned Hand supplies the paradigmatic counter-efficiency hypothesis:
> Throughout the history of these [antitrust] statutes, it has been constantly assumed that one of their purposes was to perpetuate and preserve, for its own sake and in spite of possible cost, an organization of industry of small units which can effectively compete with each other. (148 F.2d.
416,429, 1945)

It is this interpretation which Bork finds everywhere in the courts, and nowhere in the Congress of 1890, and which has led antitrust to be "a policy at war with itself."

If Senator Sherman possessed any long-lived commitment to the alleged efficiency goals of his Act, he kept them to himself. 266


Sherman's sentiments regarding the control of "one man" and
the profits accumulated by trusts, concomitant with his rejection of cost-efficiencies being realized in the form of lower prices, belies an efficiency concern for the combination issue. This concern was ably articulated in his March 21 Senate speech, his major public address on the issue:

> If the concentrated powers of this combination are intrusted to a single man, it is a kingly prerogative in- consistent with our form of govern- ment, and should be subject to the strong resistance of the state and national authorities. If anything is wrong, this is wrong. If we will not endure a king as a political power we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries of life. If we would not submit to an emperor, we should not submit to an autocrat of trade, with power to prevent competition, and to fix theprice of any commodity. (Burton [1906, 359])

One interpretation of this passage is that Sherman is concerned with "non- economic" (or nonefficiency) issues, such as the distribution of wealth and power. This is precisely the position Judge Leaned Hand took, in fact, in Alcoa. 

... Yet it is not clear. In that the senator was not of the "Chicago School," his at- tack on price-fixing may have been motivated by distributional, and not efficiency, issues.

267

"The most important measure adopted during this Congress," wrote Sherman in his autobiography, "was what was popularly known as the McKinley Tariff Law"... on October 1,1890, the tariff was "a matter of constant debate in both houses" between 1883 and 1890 (ibid., 1085), as op- posed to the monopoly law, which came and went with little discussion. Whatever cross-currents were evidenced in the analysis of the trust question, the tariff was
then well understood as a restriction of output resulting in dead-weight losses.
Most conveniently, the tariff appears on a neat continuum in our consumer welfare analysis. Compared toa free-market cartel which restricts output and still manages to sustain itself against potential competitors, a tariff, which enjoys state-enforcement of output restrictions, is bound to create a clearly more objectionable interference with "free and full competition." Certainly, this was the prevailing, "orthodox" view; according to mainstream economists of the day, monopoly problems "would arise only if such groups or classes were permitted to appropriate the political powers of the state...and create... 'artificial' monopolies by tariff and other class legislation" 267-268

Contrary to the public interest hypothesis, not only was Senator John Sherman a Republican (high tariff) vote on Senate tax questions, he was one of the protectionist system's most vocal proponents. 268

During the Sherman Act debate populists had charged that "Tariffs are the mother of trusts." "At all events," write Tarbell of the Sherman Act, "the measure was passed ahead of the tariff bill. Thus, an answer was ready for the critics. As Senator Morgan said, 'The bill was a good preface to an argument upon the protective tariff,'" 269

267



The evidence reveals that the Sherman Act was not part of a generally proconsumer campaign to remedy market power problems in the U.S. economy. Rather, it emerged as a political compromise with the following characteristics: (1) It provided incumbent Republican legislators (and their prevailing distributional coalition) with a cosmetic defense on the trust question, in anticipation of the upcoming consumer-to-industry transfers in the McKinley Tariff. (2) It gave advocates of small, localized firms some prospect of a buffer against the waves of creative destruction. (3) It did not augur to be a particularly consequential measure, as only twenty-two government actions were brought through 1904...(4) Hence, the prevailing distributional coalition got its legislative priority-higher tariffs-at what it took to be a good price. Populist critics of big business found it difficult to oppose the Sher- man Act, while large scale corporate interests found it unnecessary, particularly as how it bought the GOP room to maneuver o n its tariff hike.

If the Sherman Act had been crafted in the spirit of minimizing allocative inefficiencies, it would have been a theoretical case of immaculate conception. There was not an economist eligible for paternity. As Stigler muses: "A careful student of the history of economics would have searched long and hard on July 2 of 1890, the day the Sherman Act was signed by President Harrison, for any economist who had ever recommended the policy of actively combating collusion or monopolization in the economy at large" (1982a, 3].
