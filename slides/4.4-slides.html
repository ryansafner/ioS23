&gt; “Coase's fundamental insight [was] that transaction, coordination, and contracting costs must be considered explicitly in explaining the extent of vertical integration...[We] explore one particular cost of using the market system-the possibility of postcontractual opportunistic behavior,” (p.297)

&gt; “The particular circumstance we emphasize as likely to produce a serious threat of this type of reneging on contracts is the presence of appropriable specialized quasi rents. .hi[After a specific investment is made and such quasi rents are created, the possibility of opportunistic behavior is very real. Following Coase's framework, this problem can be solved in two possible ways: vertical integration or contracts],” (p.298)

# Solutions to Minimize Post-Contractual Opportunism

.left-column[
.center[

]

.right-column[

- Recap: a contract removes parties from a competitive market and creates bilateral dependency between them
  - incentives for post-contractual opportunism
  - parties may try to capture more quasi-rents from cooperation
  - may be caused by asset specificity

- Two general solutions:
  1. .hi[Contracting solutions]: write a better contract
  2. .hi[Vertical integration]: have one party buy the other

.smallest[
- .hi[Contract]: an agreement through which exchange is mediated
  - basically: **a promise**
  - may be written down or implied
  - enforceable in courts

- Common law recognizes a contract to be **valid** if there is:
  1. Offer and acceptance (a “meeting of the minds”)
  2. Consideration (something of value is to be transferred)
  3. An “intention to be legally bound”

- Valid contracts create legal rights and duties that are **enforceable** by courts

- An aggrieved party can sue the other party for .hi-purple[breach of contract], and court will enforce judgment

- Courts typically require defendant to pay damages
  - may invalidate a contract
  - or require “specific performance” (very rare)

# Complete Contracts

.pull-left[
.center[
![](../images/uncertainty.png)
]
]

.pull-right[

- A .hi[complete contract] (theoretically) specifies all actions or transfers that parties must take under every possible contingency

- In the real world of .hi-purple[uncertainty] (and transaction costs), complete contracts are *impossible* (and costly)

- Instead people maximize their *expected* utility given limited information at the time (.hi-purple[“bounded rationality”])

]

# Consequences of Incomplete Contracts

.pull-left[
.center[
![](../images/negotiation.jpg)
]
]

.pull-right[

- Agreements are always .hi[incomplete contracts], actions for many (unforeseen) contingencies are left *unspecified*

- Even for *specified* actions and contingencies, outcomes are indeterminate due to .hi-purple[enforcement costs]
  - argument about facts, law, interpretation
  - litigation is slow, very costly

- Gives rise to .hi-purple[opportunism] (shirking, fraud, renegotiation, hold-up, etc)

They entail costs of specifying possible contingencies and the policing and litigation costs of detecting violations and enforcing the contract in the courts,” (p.303)

  - .hi-red[Franchisor] can charge higher fees from a more valuable brand name

- Common stipulations in franchising agreements:
  - .hi-blue[Franchisees] may need to use specific equipment (e.g. certain shapes of buildings for fast food restaurants, hotels)
  - .hi-blue[Franchisees’] employees often need to go through common ("corporate") training programs to maintain quality and consistency

# Exclusive Dealing/Tie-In Contracts

.pull-left[

.pull-right[

- Many contracts (including franchises) have .hi-purple[exclusive dealing] or .hi-purple[tie-in agreements] that require firm (e.g. .hi-blue[franchisee]) to purchase inputs *exclusively* from other firm (e.g. .hi-red[franchisor]) or a designated third-party

- Sound like market power/price discrimination?

- Efficient response to horizontal &amp; vertical free riding problem
  - Easy to monitor quality

- A manufacturer in long-term contracts with retailers will often require .hi-purple[retail] or .hi-purple[resale price maintenance (RPM)]: 
  - Manufacturer often sets a *maximum* or *minimum* price that retailers can charge for their products

- Sound like a cartel agreement?

- Or maybe manufacturer trying to prevent retailers from horizontal free riding on maintaining the manufacturer’s brand

Sales are diverted from the retailers who do provide the special services at the higher price to the retailers who do not provide the special services and offer to sell the product at the lower price....A customer,because of the special services provide by one retailer, is persuaded to buy the product. But he purchases the product from another paying the latter a lower price. In this way the retailers who do not provide the special services get a free ride at the expense of those who have convinced consumers to buy the product,” (pp. 91-92).

This goodwill market-enforcement mechanism undoubtedly is a major element of the contractual alternative to vertical integration,” (p.303)

This may therefore partially explain both the reliance by firms on long-term implicit contracts with particular suppliers and the existence of reciprocity agreements among firms...The threat of termination of this relationship mutually suppresses opportunistic behavior. The premium stream can be usefully thought of as insurance payments made by the firm to prevent cheating,” (pp.304-5)

Such situations in turn are likely to arise when either the buyer or seller must make investments that have a smaller value in a use outside their own relationship than within the relationship (i.e., there exist ‘asset specificities’),” (p.692).

# Ownership As a Response to Uncertainty

&gt; “[I]f I am quite sure what kinds of actions my neighbour contemplates, I might be indifferent between his owning the field at the bottom of my garden and my owning it but renting it out for him to graze his horse in. But once I take into account that he may discover some new use for the field that I haven’t yet thought of, but would find objectionable, it will be in my interest to own the field so as to put the use of it under my own control. More generally, ownership of a resource reduces exposure to unexpected events. .hi[Property rights are a means of reducing uncertainty without needing to know precisely what the source or nature of the future concern will be],” (Littlechild 1986, p. 35.)

&gt; “We show that .hi[there can be harmful effects associated with the wrong allocation of residual rights.] In particular, a firm that purchases its supplier, thereby removing residual rights of control from the manager of the supplying company, .hi[can distort the manager's incentives sufficiently to make common ownership harmful.] We develop a theory of integration based on the .hi[attempt of parties in writing a contract to allocate efficiently the residual rights of control between themselves.]” (p.692).

- Any contract can specify who has .hi-purple[control rights under specific circumstances]
  - But not possible to do this for *all* possible circumstances, hence .hi[incomplete contracts]

- Designate a party that has .hi[residual control rights] to determine what is to be done in an unspecified circumstance

- **Benefits** of common ownership/vertical integration

  - owner (“boss”) controls physical assets to respond to unanticipated circumstances
  - can fire the division manager (formerly the purchased-firm’s manager) who causes hold-up problems

- **Costs** of common ownership/vertical integration:

- Manager of division (formerly independent firm) no longer has residual control rights
  - If that manager knows how to better respond than her new boss (manager of purchasing firm), no longer has the residual control rights
  - Must convince their boss (puchasing firm manager)

- Thus, it’s very important to allocate ownership correctly!

- If you know the .hi[Coase Theorem], it’s the same idea!
  - Resources tend to flow to those individuals/firms that value them the most, if there are clear and enforceable property rights, and transaction costs are low
  - With positive transaction costs, who is given a property right matters for efficiency!
