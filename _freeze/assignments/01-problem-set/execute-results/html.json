What about if firms are not identical, and have different costs?\n\n## Question 2\n\nAssume that consumers view tax preparation services as undifferentiated among producers, and that there are hundreds of companies offering tax preparation. The current market equilibrium price is $120. Amy's Audits is a local tax preparation firm that has a daily short-run cost structure given by:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\nC(q)&=100+4q^2\\\\\nMC(q)&=8q\\\\\n\\end{align*}$$\n\n### Part A\nHow many tax returns should Amy prepare each day if her goal is to maximize profits?\n\n### Part B\nHow much profit will she earn each day?\n\n### Part C\nAt what market price would she break even?\n\n### Part D\nBelow what hypothetical price would she shut down in the short run?\n\n### Part E\nSketch a graph and be sure to label everything you found in parts A-D. \n\n### Part F\nWhat is Amy's supply curve in the *short run*? Write a function or describe it via the graph in E.\n\n### Part G\nWhat is Amy's supply curve in the *long run*? Write a function or describe it via the graph in E.\n\n# Monopoly\n\n## Question 3\n\nWhat is the difference between allocative (in)efficiency, productive (in)efficiency, rent-seeking, and X-inefficiency?\n\n## Question 4\n\nSketch a graph of a monopoly with no fixed costs, and constant equivalent average & marginal costs. Label all of the following:\n\n- The equilibrium quantity and price if the market were competitive\n- The profit-maximizing quantity and price for the monopoly\n- The consumer surplus, producer surplus, and deadweight loss under monopoly\n\n## Question 5\n\nExplain what the goal of price discrimination is for a firm â€” *how* does price discrimination assist in maximizing profits? What are the conditions required for a firm to engage in price discrimination? What are the different types of price discrimination, and how does each work (briefly)?\n\n## Question 6\nYou are a monopoly producer of tablets. You have a cost structure: \n\n$$\\begin{align*}\nC(q)&=10q^2+200q+1000\\\\\nMC(q)&=20q+200\\\\\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nYou estimate the demand for your tablets to be: \n$$q=100-0.2p$$\nwhere $q$ is millions of tablets. \n\n### Part A\nFind the function for your marginal revenues.\n\n### Part B\nHow many tablets should you produce, and at what price, to maximize your profit?\n\n### Part C\nWhat is the cost per tablets at the quantity you are producing?\n\n### Part D\nWhat is your total profit?\n\n### Part E\nWhat would be the lowest possible price you would need to charge to break even?\n\n### Part F\nHow much of your price is markup over marginal cost?\n\n### Part G\nCalculate the elasticity of demand at your profit-maximizing price. \n\n## Question 7\n\nConsider a boat rental firm on a popular beach that has a constant average and marginal cost of $30 per boat hire. It has estimated that demand from Locals $(L)$ and demand from Tourists $(T)$ are:\n$$\\begin{align*}\nq_L&=40-0.4p\\\\\nq_T&=25-0.1p\\\\\n\\end{align*}$$\n\n### Part A\n\nSuppose it must charge a single price to all customers. Find the profit-maximizing quantity, price, and the total profits.\n\n### Part B\n\nHow much of the price is markup?\n\n### Part C\n\nWhat is the price elasticity of demand at this price?\n\n### Part D\n\nNow suppose the firm is able to segment the market and charge different prices to Tourists and Locals. Find the profit-maximizing quantity, price, and the total profits.\n\n### Part E\n\nFor each segment of the market: how much of the price is markup, and what is the price elasticity of demand at the optimal price? How did the price for each segment change from the single price (Part A), and why?\n\n\n# Factor Markets & Monopsony\n\n## Question 8 \n\nCarl's Coal Mining operates in a remote area. Because of its location, it has monopsony power in the local labor market for miners. Its marginal revenue product of labor is\n$$MRP_L = 400-5L$$\nwhere $L$ is the total number of miners. The labor supply curve of local miners is\n$$w = 5L-50$$\nwhere $w$ is the wage (in $1000's per miner).\n\n### Part A\n\nWrite a function for the marginal cost of labor.\n\n### Part B\n\nWhat quantity of workers will the mine hire, and what wage will it pay its workers?\n\n### Part C\n\nWhat would the quantity of workers be, and what would the wage be, if there was competition among other local mines for labor?\n\n### Part D\n\nSketch a graph of this market, and be sure to label all of your findings (and show the Deadweight Loss) from Parts A-C.",
