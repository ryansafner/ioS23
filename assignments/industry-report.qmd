# Overview 

Over the semester, you will write and briefly present a report on an industry that you choose that describes the market for the product: the geographic, vertical, and horizontal boundaries, the nature of competition, costs, demand, and regulatory environment. 

Please **email me** with an industry you would like to choose. I will remove countries from this list in the order that I receive emails claiming them. You may decide to change your country at any time, at which point, I will re-release the country into the pool for others to select, and update the list below:


### Claimed Industries

 You can choose any U.S. industry **except** for the following that have been claimed:

- Beer
- Wine

**Last Update: March 20, 2023**

# Assignment

I want you to compile statistics on your country (described below). You will give a presentation on your industry during the last week of class.

## Industry at a Glance

Get data from a reputable source (check back later for links) on the following statistics. You may write down just the number or descriptor for each of the following on your report.^[You might wish to make a table to organize it.] **For each, please indicate both the source of your data, and the year for the data (try to get the latest possible)**. Note that some industries may not have data available on all statistics (and be sure to note if none are available).

On the last week of class, each student will have 5 minutes to present their country. I expect each of you to have slides to describe your country.
