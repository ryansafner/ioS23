- In the Stackelberg game, we implicitly **assumed** the Leader (Coke) would .hi-purple[accommodate] the Follower (Pepsi)
  - Consider the Leader as the .hi-purple[incumbent] (firm already in the industry) and the Follower as a (potential) .hi-purple[Entrant]

- In Stackelberg, Leader produced more than Cournot, but anticipated follower still entering and producing (pushing down the market price and profits below the monopoly level)

- But there is another possibility, that the Incumbent can .hi-purple[deter entry] (a .hi-purple[“blockaded monopoly”])
  - Follower will **stay out** if it expects zero or negative post-entry profits
$$\pi_2\left(R_2(q_1^L),q_1^L\right)=0$$
  - $R_2$ is Firm 2's Cournot reaction function
  - $q_1^L$ is the .hi-purple[“limit output”]

- We can find the .hi[limit output] $q_1^L$ and .hi[limit price] $P(q_1^L)$ that successfully deters Firm 2 from entering

- With .hi-turquoise[constant returns to scale] (and identical technology), Leader **cannot** credibly deter entry by Follower (and itself earn profits)!
  - No penalty for small scale production (Follower could produce even a tiny amount and earn positive profits!)

- Limit price is $MC$ and profits for *both* firms are zero, i.e. the Bertrand or Perfectly Competitive outcome!

- It is rational for Leader to optimally **accommodate** (produce Stackelberg amount!) as opposed to **deter** entry

# Entry Deterrence Example: Economies of Scale

- With .hi-purple[economies of scale] and **fixed costs**, consider if both firms have the same technology:
$$C(q_i)=cq_i+f$$
- $c$ is variable (marginal) costs
- $f$ represents entry costs; as $\uparrow f$, the greater the economies of scale

- Follower considering entry must weigh its post-entry profits $\pi_2 = (p-c)q_2$ vs. the cost of entry $f$

- .hi-green[Example]: If $c = 0.50$ (again), and $f$ is 20, find the limit output for Firm 1 (Coke)

# Dixit Model

.smallest[
- Textbook provides a good example of a more complex model of entry deterrence (based on Dixit 1980), p.488-507, a two-stage game:
  1. Incumbent (firm 1) can sink (nonrecoverable) investment in a capacity size $k_1$ at cost $r$
  2. Entrant observes $k_1$, then decides whether to enter at entry cost $f$, and then both compete Cournot-style

- Essentially, investing in excess capacity creates an opportunity to deter potential entrants through a price war

- Alternatively, investments in capacity may lower incumbent’s $MC$ below entrant’s

- Investments in capacity are *sunk* costs

# Takeaways about Deterrence

.pull-left[

- Suggests necessary requirements for profitable strategic entry deterrence (with identical products and costs):
  1. ability of incumbents to reduce their marginal costs postentry via sunk expenditures 
  2. economies of scale
  
- If the incumbent’s capacity investments are not sunk, then Firm 1 can’t commit to producing more than Cournot (no credible threat)

- Without economies of scale, there is no profitable entry deterrence (as we saw above)

- But are *new* costs and risk to .hi-blue[Entrant], lowering expected profits

- In effect, sunk costs raise $\color{blue}{c_E}>\color{red}{c_I}$, and return us back to our Scenario II
