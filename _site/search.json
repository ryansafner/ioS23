If you are handwriting answers, you may print the pdf above and write on it, or just write on a piece of paper (we only need your answers, not the questions).\nFor the few questions that ask you to draw a graph, try to do so on your computer (use MS Paint, the drawing tools in MS Word or MS Powerpoint, plot points in MS Excel, drawing/notetaking apps, etc.), and save it as an image to include on your homework document. Again, they need not be perfect or to scale, just show that you understand the broad idea. Being able to understand and sketch the graphs is still a very important and useful skill! If all else fails, I will be lenient in grading graph questions if you are unable to technologically include a graph.\nYou may work together (and I highly encourage that) but you must turn in your own answers."

    "text": "Overview\nToday we return to finish our tour of industrial organization, i.e. the types of markets by competitiveness.\nWe first cover monopolistic competition, a much more realistic model of most firms in the real world, where firms have some market power, but are not the only producer in their industry. To model them, we blend elements of monopoly with elements of perfect competition. In the short-run, we model the firm as a monopoly acting like any monopolist would, but in the long run, there is free entry and exit, so other entrants reduce the demand for any one firm’s product (and make it more elastic) so that firms’ economic profits go to zero.\nWe finally start oligopoly, where there are a small number of firms with market power that interact strategically. While some industries in the real world are indeed dominated by a small number of firms, this type of model is applicable well beyond industries with a small number of firms, as to understand the strategic nature of firm decisions, we introduce game theory into our models."

    "text": "Take notes. On paper. Yes. Studies show that using pen and paper trump taking notes on a device. The main reason is because you cannot possibly write down everything I am saying by hand. This forces you to selectively filter my lecture to its most essential and important components – an integral part of the learning and retention process. If you are taking notes on a laptop, you become a court stenographer, thoughtlessly transcribing everything I am saying. At the other extreme, do not assume everything is written in my lecture slides. My lecture slides are visuals and cues to organize the content both for me and for you. I try hard to make sure that I have few words on slides, and even fewer answers to problems.\n\nMy suggestion: print out my lecture slides in advance (or follow along on your device) and take additional notes by hand.\n\nAt least skim all of the readings. I give out readings for a reason, and that reason is not to bore you or waste your time. The truth is, as a beginner, you can’t rely on heuristics or memory to “fill in the blanks.” You need the readings to provide context to what I am saying in class. I cannot help you if you are not going to try. Any professor also will lose patience at short notice when it’s discovered you haven’t done the reading.\nDo the homeworks (if there are any). You might be surprised that I need to say this, but I do. Students that do not do the homeworks do poorly on exams, which often are similar to homework questions. Homeworks are the best practice for exams, they give you a sense of the relevant content areas that might come up, the type and style of questions that I ask, and you often get answer keys to help you “get inside my head” and study from. There is no good reason why you should have a low homework grade.\nWork on assignments together and study together. Recognize that you are not in this alone, and other students are just as anxious or uncertain as you are. More surprisingly, other students probably have some answers you are looking for, and you may have answers for some of their problems! You will learn better when you collaborate with others similar to you. More importantly, you don’t truly understand something unless you can explain it to others.1 As a wise woman once told me “whomever is doing the talking is doing the learning.”\nLearn how to learn. The most important skill you learn in college is how to learn. Taking a course on a subject will not make you an expert on that subject. It a) helps you recognize that you do not know everything on that subject, and this prevents you from actively saying stupid things; and b) gives you enough context and skills to figure out how to actually fill those gaps. This is the actual skill that’s relevant in the real world.2\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nYes, that means I am doing a ton of learning every time I teach!↩︎\nYes, Google is your best friend. But you do not yet know how to ask the right questions, or understand what constitutes good answers.↩︎"

Hayek (1974 Economics Nobel Laureate)–>\nIndustrial Organization is one of the most common fields of applied microeconomics. It traditionally studies business firms and their relationship to the market—how they make economic decisions, how they are affected by government regulation, how they strategically interact with one another—and how these change in markets that are more or less competitive—monopoly, oligopoly, monopolistic competition, or perfect competition, often with a close connection to antitrust law. Industrial organization is a direct extension of microeconomics, and as such, the prerequisite for this course is ECON 206.\nThis course will be a hybrid of formal lecture, hands-on activities/games, and readings-based class discussions, with exams and a writing assignment serving as the prime means of evaluation.\nI reserve the right to change any part of this syllabus and course, at my discretion, with proper advance warning."

Some assignments may require in-class participation for credit, and an (unexcused) absence may be detrimental to your grade. Attending class is one of the strongest predictors of success.\nIf you know you will be absent, you are not required to let me know, but it is polite to give notice (Note if I do not reply to an email of yours letting me know, I am probably busy but will still see it and appreciate your email). Your absence will be noted and recorded for the purposes stated above. If, however, we have an assignment due in class, you must notify me ahead of time in order to make alternate arrangements to still receive credit. Hasty ex-post attempts to notify me will generate little sympathy."

However, if you turn in a homework after the answer key is posted, I will automatically deduct 20 points (so the maximum grade you can earn on it is an 80).\nExams: If you know that you will be unable to complete an in-class exam as scheduled for a legitimate reason, please notify me at least one week in advance, and we will schedule a make-up exam date. Failure to do so, including desperate attempts to make arrangements only after the exam will result in a grade of 0 and little sympathy.\nI reserve the right to re-weight assignments for students whom I believe are legitimately unable to complete a particular assignment."

Written communications, like blog posts or use of the Zoom chat, lacks important nonverbal cues (such as body language, tone of voice, sarcasm, etc).\nAbove all else, please respect one another and think/reread carefully about how others may see your post before you submit a comment. You are expected to disagree and have different opinions, this is inherently valuable in a discussion. Please be civil and constructive in responding to others’ comments: writing “have you considered ‘X’?” is a lot more helpful to all involved than just writing “well you’re just wrong.”\nPosting content that is wilfully incindiary, illegal, or that constitutes academic dishonesty (such as plagarism) will automatically earn a grade of 0 and may be elevated to other authorities on campus.\nWhen using the chat function on Zoom or public Slack channels, please treat it as official course communications, even though I may not be grading it. It may be a quick and informal tool - don’t feel you need to worry about spelling or perfect grammar - but please try to avoid too informal “text-speak” (i.e. say “That’s good for you” instead of “thas good 4 u”)."

Cheating, plagiarism, lying, and stealing are all prohibited. All violations of the Honor Code are taken seriously, will be reported to appropriate authority, and may result in severe penalties, including expulsion from the college. See here for more detailed information.\n\nChatGPT\nThe rise of ChatGPT and other large language models has made it incredibly easy to look up information and write content. This emerging capability will inevitably run up against existing (nearing obsolete) policies regarding academic integrity. Learning to leverage AI is an emerging skill, and one that can help you enhance your productivity.\nIn the end, you are ultimately responsible for all the content that you submit for assignments in this course. If it is clear that you simply submitted the results of a ChatGPT prompt for an assignment (and new tools are emerging to accurately detect his), you will earn a grade of zero. If it is clear that this is a frequent issue and you are applying no effort to your assignment beyond ChatGPT prompts, you will be reported for violations of the Academic Honor Code.\nBeware the limits of ChatGPT and other LLM-based AIs: low-quality prompts will give you low quality results, and ones that are obvious that the content was written by an LLM. The writing style and type of information that it outputs is fairly easy to detect among an expert in the field (i.e. me, if you ask it questions about economics, especially my assignments). Do not trust everything it says, it can pass off facts and arguments as authoritative. I have given it prompts and it gave me answers that it completely fabricated."
