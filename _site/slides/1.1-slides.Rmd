# Challenges to Consider

.pull-left[

- Positive correlation between concentration (fewer, bigger firms) and profits across industries

- Is this because:
  a. big firms buy up their rivals to capture market share *and then* earn higher profits (anti-competitive)
  b. more efficient firms earn higher profits and outlast inefficient firms earning losses that go out of business or are acquired (pro-competitive)

# Some Questions for the Semester

1. Has there been a **general increase in market power/concentration**?

2. If so, what should we do about it?

3. Should we revitalize **antitrust laws**?

4. Are **platforms** like Facebook, Amazon, Google, etc. uniquely problematic? How should we regulate them?

5. Should your **data** be **owned** (and compensated) as **labor**?

6. Will **automation** take all the jobs? If so, what do we do about that?
