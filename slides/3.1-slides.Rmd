- A bargaining problem between .red[Coke] and .blue[Pepsi]

> “The present paper accepts the hypothesis that oligopolists wish to collude to maximize joint profits. It seeks to reconcile this wish with the facts, such as that collusion is impossible for many firms and collusion is much more effective in some circumstances than in others. The reconciliation is found in the problem of policing a collusive agreement, which proves to be a problem in the theory of information,” (44).

> “We shall show that collusion normally involves much more than ‘the’ price...The colluding firms must agree upon the price structure appropriate to the transaction classes which they are prepared to recognize. A complete profit-maximizing price structure may have almost infinitely numerous price classes: the firms will have to decide upon the number of price classes in the light of the costs and returns from tailoring prices to the diversity of transactions,” (44-46).

> “Let us assume that the collusion has been effected, and a price structure agreed upon. It is a well-established proposition that if any member of the agreement can secretly violate it, he will gain larger profits than by conforming to it. It is, moreover, surely one of the axioms of human behavior that all agreements whose violation would be profitable to the violator must be enforced. The literature of collusive agreements...is replete with instances of the collapse of conspiracies because of ‘secret’ price-cutting. This literature is biased: conspiracies that are successful in avoiding an amount of price-cutting which leads to collapse of the agreement are less likely to be reported or detected. But no conspiracy can neglect the problem of enforcement,” (46)

> “Enforcement consists basically of detecting significant deviations from the agreed-upon prices. Once detected, the deviations will tend to disappear because they are no longer secret and will be matched by fellow conspirators if they are not withdrawn. If the enforcement is weak, however — if price-cutting is detected only slowly and incompetently — the conspiracy must recognize its weakness: it must set prices not much above the competitive level so the inducements to price-cutting are small...” (46).

- We should focus oligopoly theory less on static models of Cournot/Bertrand/etc competition

- Focus more on examining the types of conditions where firms can effectively form and maintain collusive agreements, and conditions where agreements break down into competition

# Payoffs in Grim Trigger Strategy

    - If you both *Cooperate* forever, you receive an infinite payoff stream of 50 per round

$$50+50\delta^1+50\delta^2+50\delta^3+\cdots+50\delta^{\infty}=\frac{50}{1-\delta}$$

$$\begin{align*}
\text{Payoff to cooperation} & > \text{Payoff to one-time defection}\\

  1. $a$ (the temptation payoff) increases (decreases)
  2. $b$ (the cooperative payoff) decreases (increases)
  3. $c$ (the defection payoff) increases (decreases)

- If this is true, *many* strategies can sustain long-run cooperation
