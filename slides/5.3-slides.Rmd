> “None of this is necessarily monopolistic (although monopoly may play some role). Profit does not arise because the firm creates ‘artificial scarcity’ through a reduction in its output. Nor does it arise because of collusion. Superior performance can be attributed to the combination of great uncertainty plus luck or atypical insight by the management of a firm. It is not until the experiments are actually tried that we learn which succeed and which fail. By the time the results are in, it is the shareholder that has captured (some of) the value, positive or negative, of past decisions. Even though the profits that arise from a firm's activities may be eroded by competitive imitation, since information is costly to obtain and techniques are difficult to duplicate, the firm may enjoy growth and a superior rate of return for some time,” (p.3).

> “Superior ability also may be interpreted as a competitive basis for acquiring a measure of monopoly power. In a world in which information is costly and the future is uncertain, a firm that seizes an opportunity to better serve customers does so because it expects to enjoy some protection from rivals because of their ignorance of this opportunity or because of their inability timitate quickly. One possible source of some monopoly power is superior entrepreneurship. Our patent, copyright, and trademark laws explicitly provide as a reward for uncovering new methods (and for revealing these methods), legal protection against free imitation, and it may be true in some cases that an astute rival acquires the exclusive rights to some resource that later becomes valuable. There is no reason to suppose that competitive behavior never yields monopoly power, although in many cases such power may be exercised not by creating entry barriers, but through the natural frictions and ignorance that characterize any real economy. If rivals seek better ways to satisfy buyers or to produce a product, and if one or a few succeed in such endeavors, then the reward for their entrepreneurial efforts is likely to be some (short term) monopoly power and this may be associated with increased industrial concentration. To destroy such power when it arises may very well remove the incentive for progress,” (p.3)

> “Despite the obvious importance of the question to a statute as vaguely phrased as the Sherman Act, the federal courts in all the years since 1890 have never arrived at a definitive statement of the values or policies which control the law's application and evolution. The question of values, therefore, remains central to the controversy about this basic law and its interpretation...Nevertheless, a starting point is the question of legislative intent. In this paper I propose to answer the question.. My conclusion, drawn from the evidence in the Congressional Record, is that Congress intended the courts to implement (that is, to take into account in the decision of cases) only that value we would today call consumer welfare. To put it another way, the policy the courts were intended to apply is the maximization of wealth or consumer want satisfaction. This requires courts to distinguish between agreements or activities that increase wealth through efficiency and those that decrease it through restriction of output,” (p.7).

“Values other than consumer welfare apparently played large roles in [some famous cases]...In *Alcoa*, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit judged illegal Aluminum Company of America’s large market position in virgin aluminum ingot.

in 1890 was a desire to put an end to great aggregations of capital because of the helplessness of the individual before them.’ (Emphasis added).

]

Without pausing to explain what the noneconomic helplessness of the individual might consist of, what category of individuals was involved, or how the concept applied to the facts of the case before him, Judge Hand moved on to another formulation of noneconomic values supposedly embedded in the statute:

- 1978 *Paradox of Antitrust*

- Antitrust law (as it was practiced into the 1960s) is a paradox: it was being used to .hi[protect competitors] by making it .hi[illegal to compete], which hurts consumers

- Antitrust law and enforcement consists of a conflict of interests:
  1. Consumer welfare
  2. Protectionism for small businesses

- Antitrust law protects some businesses by restraining competition
  - restraining largest businesses because they are "too big"
  - might be that they are the most efficient!

[these statements] are clearly, though unintentionally, misleading...The point here is that the history cited does not exist. Never has ‘experience’ demonstrated the anticompetitive nature of any of these practices. Experience may demonstrate that a practice raises prices or that it injures a rival, but that is all, and many competitive practices do the same things. Only theory can separate the competitive from the anticompeteive, and as for that, these rules referred to were not estliabhed on a foundation of ‘analysis,’” (p.12)

Failure to consider productive efficiency—or worse, the tendency to view it as pernicious by calling it a ‘barrier to entry’ or a ‘competitive advantage’—is probably the major reason for the deformation of antitrust’s doctrines.”

Was not the nineteenth century the period in which the benevolent effects of competition were most widely extolled? Should not a profession praise a Congress which seeks to legislate its textbook assumptions into practice? And with even modest foresight, should not the economists have foreseen that the Sherman Act would put more into economists' purses than perhaps any other law ever passed?," (1).

# "New Learning" in Industrial Organization

.smallest[
> "A clue to a more satisfactory explanation may be found in the 'new learning' of industrial organization. Much of this learning doubts that antitrust law promotes competition. Brozen (1982, 14) for example, concludes that antitrust laws 'are themselves restraining output and the growth of productivity.' Harold Demsetz has said that if certain policies were continued, he would favor outright repeal of the Sherman Act...McGee (1971,16) for example says, 'for a variety of reasons, it is simply *not* correct to assume that atomistic competition is the ultimate *policy* goal; or to regard departures from that kind of competition as necessarily bad.'...Johnson (1983,3) writes '...the competitive model of economic theory not only offers littled guidance [for antitrust law], but actually points us in the wrong direction. The confusion arises because many economists fail to realize that the 'competitive model' is silent on the subject of competition," (DiLorezno and High, 1988: 424)

Rural cattlemen and butchers were especially eager to have statutes enacted that would thwart competition from the newly centralized meat processing facilities in Chicago. The evidence on price and output in these industries, moreover, does not support the conjecture that these industries suffered from a monopoly in the late nineteenth century, if monopoly is understood in the conventional neoclassical way as an organization of industry which tends to restrict output and raise prices. These industries were fiercely competitive because of relatively free entry and rapid technological advances such as refrigeration," (p.93)

> “One interpretation of this passage is that Sherman is concerned with ‘non-economic’ (or nonefficiency) issues, such as the distribution of wealth and power. This is precisely the position Judge Leaned Hand took, in fact, in Alcoa...Yet it is not clear. In that the senator was not of the ‘Chicago School,’ his attack on price-fixing may have been motivated by distributional, and not efficiency, issues,’ (p.267).

> “‘The most important measure adopted during this Congress,’"wrote Sherman in his autobiography, ‘was what was popularly known as the McKinley Tariff Law’... on October 1,1890, the tariff was ’a matter of constant debate in both houses’ between 1883 and 1890...as opposed to the monopoly law, which came and went with little discussion. Whatever cross-currents were evidenced in the analysis of the trust question, the tariff was then well understood as a restriction of output resulting in dead-weight losses. Most conveniently, the tariff appears on a neat continuum in our consumer welfare analysis. Compared to a free-market cartel which restricts output and still manages to sustain itself against potential competitors, a tariff, which enjoys state-enforcement of output restrictions, is bound to create a clearly more objectionable interference with ‘free and full competition.’ Certainly, this was the prevailing, ‘orthodox’ view; according to mainstream economists of the day, monopoly problems ‘would arise only if such groups or classes were permitted to appropriate the political powers of the state...and create... ’artificial’ monopolies by tariff and other class legislation’” 267-268
 (p.267).

> “Contrary to the public interest hypothesis, not only was Senator John Sherman a Republican (high tariff) vote on Senate tax questions, he was one of the protectionist system's most vocal proponents,” (p.268).

> “During the Sherman Act debate populists had charged that ‘Tariffs are the mother of trusts.’ ‘At all events,’ write Tarbell of the Sherman Act, ‘the measure was passed ahead of the tariff bill. Thus, an answer was ready for the critics. As Senator Morgan said, ‘The bill was a good preface to an argument upon the protective tariff,’” (p.269).

> “The evidence reveals that the Sherman Act was not part of a generally proconsumer campaign to remedy market power problems in the U.S. economy. Rather, it emerged as a political compromise with the following characteristics: (1) It provided incumbent Republican legislators (and their prevailing distributional coalition) with a cosmetic defense on the trust question, in anticipation of the upcoming consumer-to-industry transfers in the McKinley Tariff. (2) It gave advocates of small, localized firms some prospect of a buffer against the waves of creative destruction. (3) It did not augur to be a particularly consequential measure, as only twenty-two government actions were brought through 1904...(4) Hence, the prevailing distributional coalition got its legislative priority-higher tariffs-at what it took to be a good price. Populist critics of big business found it difficult to oppose the Sher- man Act, while large scale corporate interests found it unnecessary, particularly as how it bought the GOP room to maneuver o n its tariff hike.” (p.273).

> “If the Sherman Act had been crafted in the spirit of minimizing allocative inefficiencies, it would have been a theoretical case of immaculate conception. There was not an economist eligible for paternity. As Stigler muses: "A careful student of the history of economics would have searched long and hard on July 2 of 1890, the day the Sherman Act was signed by President Harrison, for any economist who had ever recommended the policy of actively combating collusion or monopolization in the economy at large” (p.274).
