- In the Stackelberg game, we implicitly **assumed** the Leader (Coke) would .hi-purple[accommodate] the Follower (Pepsi)
  - Consider the Leader as the .hi-purple[incumbent] (firm already in the industry) and the Follower as a (potential) .hi-purple[Entrant]

- In Stackelberg, Leader produced more than Cournot, but anticipated follower still entering and producing (pushing down the market price and profits below the monopoly level)

- But there is another possibility, that the Incumbent can .hi-purple[deter entry] (a .hi-purple[“blockaded monopoly”])
  - Follower will **stay out** if it expects zero or negative post-entry profits
`$$\pi_2\left(R_2(q_1^L),q_1^L\right)=0$$`
  - `\(R_2\)` is Firm 2's Cournot reaction function
  - `\(q_1^L\)` is the .hi-purple[“limit output”]

- We can find the .hi[limit output] `\(q_1^L\)` and .hi[limit price] `\(P(q_1^L)\)` that successfully deters Firm 2 from entering

# Entry Deterrence Example: Economies of Scale

- With .hi-purple[economies of scale] and **fixed costs**, consider if both firms have the same technology:
`$$C(q_i)=cq_i+f$$`
- `\(c\)` is variable (marginal) costs
- `\(f\)` represents entry costs; as `\(\uparrow f\)`, the greater the economies of scale

- Follower considering entry must weigh its post-entry profits `\(\pi_2 = (p-c)q_2\)` vs. the cost of entry `\(f\)`

- .hi-green[Example]: If `\(c = 0.50\)` (again), and `\(f\)` is 20, find the limit output for Firm 1 (Coke)

# Entry Deterrence Example: Economies of Scale

`$$\begin{align*}
p&amp;=5-0.05(50)\\
p &amp;= 2.50\\ \end{align*}$$`

- Coke’s total profits (including fixed costs):

`\(\pi_c=(2.50-0.50)50 - 20 = 80\)`.

# Dixit Model

.pull-left[

.smallest[
- Textbook provides a good example of a more complex model of entry deterrence (based on Dixit 1980), p.488-507, a two-stage game:
  1. Incumbent (firm 1) can sink (nonrecoverable) investment in a capacity size `\(k_1\)` at cost `\(r\)`
  2. Entrant observes `\(k_1\)`, then decides whether to enter at entry cost `\(f\)`, and then both compete Cournot-style

- Essentially, investing in excess capacity creates an opportunity to deter potential entrants through a price war

- Alternatively, investments in capacity may lower incumbent’s `\(MC\)` below entrant’s

- Investments in capacity are *sunk* costs

# Dixit Model

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Essentially, investment in capacity is a sunk cost, used to potentially deter entry
  - Firm 1 invests in capacity to ensure it can produce the limit output to deter Firm 2 from entry

- With significant .hi-purple[economies of scale (fixed costs)], need not invest in *excess* capacity since monopoly output may be at least as large as the limit output to deter Firm 2

- With limited economies of scale, firm 1 would need to strategically *over*-invest in capacity (beyond monopoly level) to commit to deterring firm 2

# Takeaways about Deterrence

.pull-left[

- Suggests necessary requirements for profitable strategic entry deterrence (with identical products and costs):
  1. ability of incumbents to reduce their marginal costs postentry via sunk expenditures 
  2. economies of scale
  
- If the incumbent’s capacity investments are not sunk, then Firm 1 can’t commit to producing more than Cournot (no credible threat)

- Without economies of scale, there is no profitable entry deterrence (as we saw above)

# Commitments

.pull-left[
.smaller[
- A .hi[commitment] is an action taken .hi-purple[unconditional] on other players' actions that **limits your own actions**

- Only a *visible* and *irreversible* commitment makes a strategic threat or promise **credible**
  - *forces* you to follow through with your threat/promise, **even, and especially, if you don't actually want to**

- Can change outcomes of second-stage games; changes other players' expectations of the consequences of their own actions
