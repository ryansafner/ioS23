# Review of Theory of the Firm

- **Smith**: division of labor is limited by the extent of the market

- **Young**: specialization yields opportunities for innovation, tools, and capital replacing labor to enhance productivity

- **Coase**: producers decide whether it is cheaper to produce in-house vs. contracting
  - depends on extent of the market
  
- **Stigler**: tasks within production become specialized firms as industry expands, then contracts

> “.hi[At first glance, it is not entirely obvious why the suppliers of capital get anything back.] After all, they part with their money, and have little to contribute to the enterprise afterward. The professional managers or entrepreneurs who run the firms might as well abscond with the money. Although they sometimes do, usually they do not. Most advanced market economies have solved the problem of corporate governance at least reasonably well, in that they have assured the flows of enormous amounts of capital to firms, and actual repatriation of profits to the providers of finance. But this does not imply that they have solved the corporate governance problem perfectly, or that the corporate governance mechanisms cannot be improved,” (p.737).

> “The critics have it wrong. There are serious problems with CEO compensation, but ‘excessive’ pay is not the biggest issue. The relentless focus on how much CEOs are paid diverts public attention from the real problem—how CEOs are paid. In most publicly held companies, the compensation of top executives is virtually independent of performance. On average, corporate America pays its most important leaders like bureaucrats. Is it any wonder then that so many CEOs act like bureaucrats rather than the value-maximizing entrepreneurs companies need to enhance their standing in world markets?,” (p.138).

> “The basic proposition advanced in this paper is that the control of corporations may constitute a valuable asset; that this asset exists independent of any interest in either economics of scale or monopoly profits; that an active market for corporate control exists; and that a great many mergers are probably the result of the successful workings of this special market,” (p.112).

> “A fundamental premise underlying the market for corporate control is the existence of a high positive correlation between corporate managerial efficiency and the market price of shares of that company.'O As an existing company is poorly managed - in the sense of not making as great a return for the shareholders as could be accomplished under other feasible managements - the market price oi the shares declines relative to the shares of other companies in the same industry or relative to the market as a whole,” (p.112).

> “Share price, or that part reflecting managerial efficiency, also measures the potential capital gain inherent in the corporate stock. The lower the stock price, relative to what it could be with more efficient management, the more attractive the take-over becomes to those who believe they can manage the company more efficiently. And the potential returns from the successful take-over and revitalization of a poorly run company can be enormous,” (p.113).
