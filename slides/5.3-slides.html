&gt; “This paper takes a critical view of contemporary doctrine in this area [of identifying monopolies and monopolization] and presents data which suggest that this doctrine offers a dangerous base upon which to build a policy toward business.” (p.1).

&gt; “Under the pressure of competitive rivalry, and in the apparent absence of effective barriers to entry, it would seem that the concentration of an industry's output in a few firms could only derive from their superiority in producing and marketing products or in the superiority of a structure of industry in which there are only a few firms,” (p.1).

&gt; “None of this is necessarily monopolistic (although monopoly may play some role). Profit does not arise because the firm creates ‘artificial scarcity’ through a reduction in its output. Nor does it arise because of collusion. Superior performance can be attributed to the combination of great uncertainty plus luck or atypical insight by the management of a firm. It is not until the experiments are actually tried that we learn which succeed and which fail. By the time the results are in, it is the shareholder that has captured (some of) the value, positive or negative, of past decisions. Even though the profits that arise from a firm's activities may be eroded by competitive imitation, since information is costly to obtain and techniques are difficult to duplicate, the firm may enjoy growth and a superior rate of return for some time,” (p.3).

&gt; “Superior ability also may be interpreted as a competitive basis for acquiring a measure of monopoly power. In a world in which information is costly and the future is uncertain, a firm that seizes an opportunity to better serve customers does so because it expects to enjoy some protection from rivals because of their ignorance of this opportunity or because of their inability timitate quickly. One possible source of some monopoly power is superior entrepreneurship. Our patent, copyright, and trademark laws explicitly provide as a reward for uncovering new methods (and for revealing these methods), legal protection against free imitation, and it may be true in some cases that an astute rival acquires the exclusive rights to some resource that later becomes valuable. There is no reason to suppose that competitive behavior never yields monopoly power, although in many cases such power may be exercised not by creating entry barriers, but through the natural frictions and ignorance that characterize any real economy. If rivals seek better ways to satisfy buyers or to produce a product, and if one or a few succeed in such endeavors, then the reward for their entrepreneurial efforts is likely to be some (short term) monopoly power and this may be associated with increased industrial concentration. To destroy such power when it arises may very well remove the incentive for progress,” (p.3)

&gt; “Despite the obvious importance of the question to a statute as vaguely phrased as the Sherman Act, the federal courts in all the years since 1890 have never arrived at a definitive statement of the values or policies which control the law's application and evolution. The question of values, therefore, remains central to the controversy about this basic law and its interpretation...Nevertheless, a starting point is the question of legislative intent. In this paper I propose to answer the question.. My conclusion, drawn from the evidence in the Congressional Record, is that Congress intended the courts to implement (that is, to take into account in the decision of cases) only that value we would today call consumer welfare. To put it another way, the policy the courts were intended to apply is the maximization of wealth or consumer want satisfaction. This requires courts to distinguish between agreements or activities that increase wealth through efficiency and those that decrease it through restriction of output,” (p.7).

&gt; “Failure to settle the issue of values has led inevitably to a degree of irresponsibility in the judicial process...Often a court will announce a value in deciding a Sherman Act case without explaining either the selection of the value or the method of its application to the facts...One is tempted, and perhaps occasionally entitled, to suspect that such a suddenly appearing value is a *deus ex machina* by which the court rescues itself from the perplexing task of economic analysis and judgment that rigorous adherence to a consumer-welfare value premise would sometimes require,” (pp.7-8).

“Values other than consumer welfare apparently played large roles in [some famous cases]...In *Alcoa*, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit judged illegal Aluminum Company of America’s large market position in virgin aluminum ingot. In an assertion seemingly important to his argument, Judge Hand said:

.tiny[
&gt; ‘We have been speaking only of the economic reasons which forbid monopoly; but...there are others, based upon the belief that great industrial consolidations are inherently undesirable, *regardless of their economic results.* In the debates in Congress Senator Sherman himself...showed that among the purposes of Congress
in 1890 was a desire to put an end to great aggregations of capital because of the helplessness of the individual before them.’ (Emphasis added).

]

Without pausing to explain what the noneconomic helplessness of the individual might consist of, what category of individuals was involved, or how the concept applied to the facts of the case before him, Judge Hand moved on to another formulation of noneconomic values supposedly embedded in the statute:

.tiny[
&gt; ‘Throughout the history of the statutes [the antitrust laws, including the Sherman Act] it has been constantly assumed that one of their purposes was to perpetuate and preserve, for its own sake and *in spite of the possible cost*, an organization of industry in small units which can effectively compete with each other.’

The passage was followed immediately by: ‘We hold ‘Alcoa’s’ monopoly of ingot was the kind covered by Sec. 2 [of the Sherman Act].’

&gt; “The legislative history, in fact, contains no colorable support for application by courts of any value premise or policy other than the maximization of consumer welfare.

- 1978 *Paradox of Antitrust*

- Antitrust law (as it was practiced into the 1960s) is a paradox: it was being used to .hi[protect competitors] by making it .hi[illegal to compete], which hurts consumers

- Antitrust law and enforcement consists of a conflict of interests:
  1. Consumer welfare
  2. Protectionism for small businesses

- Antitrust law protects some businesses by restraining competition
  - restraining largest businesses because they are "too big"
  - might be that they are the most efficient!

As to each of these practicices, experience and analysis have established the utter lack of justification to excuse its inherent threat to competition’ ... [these statements] are clearly, though unintentionally, misleading...The point here is that the history cited does not exist. Never has ‘experience’ demonstrated the anticompetitive nature of any of these practices. Experience may demonstrate that a practice raises prices or that it injures a rival, but that is all, and many competitive practices do the same things. Only theory can separate the competitive from the anticompeteive, and as for that, these rules referred to were not estliabhed on a foundation of ‘analysis,’” (p.12)

&gt; “The lines along which the law should be reformed are clear...:”

&gt; “(1) The goal that should guide the interpretation of the antitrust laws is the welfare of consumers. Departures from that standard destroy the consistency and predictability of the law; run counter to the legislative intent...; and damage the integrity of the judicial process by involving the courts in grossly political choices for which neither the statutes nor any other acceptable source provide any guidance.”(p.421)

&gt; “(2) In judging consumer welfare, productive efficiency, the single most important factor contributing to that welfare, must be given due weight along with allocative efficiency. Failure to consider productive efficiency—or worse, the tendency to view it as pernicious by calling it a ‘barrier to entry’ or a ‘competitive advantage’—is probably the major reason for the deformation of antitrust’s doctrines.”

&gt; (3) The law should be reformed so that it strikes at three classes of behavior:
&gt; &gt; (a) The suppression of competition by horizontal agreement, such as the nonancillary agreements of rivals or potential rivals to fix prices or divide markets.
&gt; &gt; (b) Horizontal mergers creating very large market shares (those that have fewer than three significant rivals in any market).
&gt; &gt; (c) Deliberate predation engaged in to drive rivals from a market, prevent or delay the entry of rivals, or discipline existing rivals. The kinds of predation that are likely to occur have been discussed, and care must be taken not to confuse hard competition with predation.

&gt; (4) The law should permit agreements on prices, territories, refusals to deal, and other suppressions of rivalry that are ancillary, i nthe ense discussed, to an integration of productive economic activity. It should abandon its concern with such beneficial practices as small horizontal mergers, all vertical or conglomerate mergers, vertical price maintenance and market division, tying arrangements, exclusive dealing and requirements contracts, ‘predatory’ price cutting, and the like. Antittrust should have no concern with any firm size or industry structure created by internal growth or by a merger more than ten years old.

# "New Learning" in Industrial Organization

&gt; "A clue to a more satisfactory explanation may be found in the 'new learning' of industrial organization. Much of this learning doubts that antitrust law promotes competition. Brozen (1982, 14) for example, concludes that antitrust laws 'are themselves restraining output and the growth of productivity.' Harold Demsetz has said that if certain policies were continued, he would favor outright repeal of the Sherman Act...McGee (1971,16) for example says, 'for a variety of reasons, it is simply *not* correct to assume that atomistic competition is the ultimate *policy* goal; or to regard departures from that kind of competition as necessarily bad.'...Johnson (1983,3) writes '...the competitive model of economic theory not only offers littled guidance [for antitrust law], but actually points us in the wrong direction. The confusion arises because many economists fail to realize that the 'competitive model' is silent on the subject of competition," (DiLorezno and High, 1988: 424)

&gt; "The *Standard Oil* case of 1911 is a landmark in the development of antitrust law. But it is more than a famous law case: it created a legend. The firm whose history it relates to became the archetype of predatory monopoly," (p.137)

&gt; "According to most accounts, the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey established an oil refining monopoly in the United States, in large part through the systematic use of predatory price discrimination. Standard struck down its competitors, in one market at a time, until it enjoyed a monopoly position everywhere. Similarly, it preserved its monopoly by cutting prices selectively wherever competitors dared enter...The main trouble with this 'history' is that it is logically deficient, and I can find little or no evidence to support it," (p.138).

&gt; "In the beginning, oil refining in the United States apparently was competitive...The number of refiners was evidently large, since the Standard interests bought out more than a hundred of them. Standard Oil was not born with monopoly power: as late as 1870 it had only 10 per cent of the refining business" (p.138-139).

&gt; “The usual argument that local price cutting is a monopolizing technique *begins* by assuming that the predator has important monopoly power, which is his ‘war chest’ for supporting the unprofitable raids and forays. Evidently the technique could not be used until the Standard interests achieved the necessary monopoly power...A simpler technique did exist, and Standard used it. Unless there are legal restraints, anyone can monopolize an industry through mergers and acquisitions, paying for the acquisitions by permitting participation of the former owners in the expected monopoly profits,” (p.139).

&gt; "To sum up: (1) Predatory price cutting does not explain how a seller acquires monopoly power that he must have before he could practice it. (2) Whereas it is *conceivable* that someone might embark on a predatory program, I cannot see that it would pay him to do so, since outright purchase is both cheaper and more reliable...(4) Actual variations in prices among markets may be accounted for in terms of variations in demand elasticities, but do not establish that anybody is preying on anybody else,” (p.143).

&gt; “Judging from the Record, Standard Oil did not use predatory price discrimination to drive out competing refiners, nor did its pricing practice have that effect...To do so would have been foolish; and, whatever else has been said about them, the old Standard organization was seldom criticized for making less money when it could readily have made more...Anyone who has relied upon price discrimination to explain Standard’s dominance would do well to start looking for something else. The place to start is merger.” (p.143).

&gt; “It should be quite clear that this is not a verdict of acquittal for the Standard Oil company; the issue of monopoly remains. What this study says is that Standard did not achieve or maintain a monopoly position through price discrimination...what businessmen *do* to one another is much less significant to monopoly than what they find useful to do together to serve their common interest,” (pp.143-144).

# Changes in Price Under the Pre-Sherman Act "Trusts"

&gt; "...I compiled from the *Congressional Record* of the 51st Congress a list of industries that were accused of being monopolized by trusts. The graph...shows the industries for which data on output from 1880 to 1900 are available...of the 17 industries, there were *increases* in output...in all but two industries, matches and castor oil...In addition, output in these industries generally expanded more rapidly than output in other industries during the 10 years leading up to the first trust-busting legislation," (p.35).

# Changes in Price Under the Pre-Sherman Act "Trusts"

&gt; "And predictably, prices in these industries were generally *falling*, not rising, even when compared to the declining general price level. For example, the average price of steel rails fell from $58 to $32 between 1880 and 1890, or by 53 percent. The price of refined sugar fell from 9 cents per pound in 1880 to 7 cents in 1890 and to 4.5 cents in 1900; the price oflead dropped from $5.04 per pound in 1880 to $4.41 in 1890; and zinc fell from $5.51 per pound to $4.40...Perhaps the most widely attacked trusts were those in the sugar and petroleum industries. But there is evidence that the effect of these combinations or mergers was to *reduce* the prices of sugar and petroleum," (pp.35-36)

# Antitrust As Rent-Seeking

&gt; "The political impetus for some kind of antitrust law came from the farm lobbies of mostly midwestern, agricultural states, such as Missouri. Rural cattlemen and butchers were especially eager to have statutes enacted that would thwart competition from the newly centralized meat processing facilities in Chicago. The evidence on price and output in these industries, moreover, does not support the conjecture that these industries suffered from a monopoly in the late nineteenth century, if monopoly is understood in the conventional neoclassical way as an organization of industry which tends to restrict output and raise prices. These industries were fiercely competitive because of relatively free entry and rapid technological advances such as refrigeration," (p.93)

&gt; “The proconsumer view of the Sherman Act has been most thoroughly elaborated by Robert Bork...The law, argues Bork, should be interpreted as wholly devoted to maximizing economic efficiency,” (p.264).

&gt; “The policy importance of this interpretation is vast. Antitrust courts have repeatedly found various "noneconomic" grounds for preserving particular firms or market forms, the classic being Justice Peckham's concern over the "small dealers and worthy men" (U.S. v. Trans Missouri, [1897]) who deserved a judicial reprieve from competitive extinction. This line of reasoning forms the basis of the protectionist thrust in antitrust law. In his famous Alcoa decision, Judge Learned Hand supplies the paradigmatic counter-efficiency hypothesis:

&gt; “‘The most important measure adopted during this Congress,’"wrote Sherman in his autobiography, ‘was what was popularly known as the McKinley Tariff Law’... on October 1,1890, the tariff was ’a matter of constant debate in both houses’ between 1883 and 1890...as opposed to the monopoly law, which came and went with little discussion. Whatever cross-currents were evidenced in the analysis of the trust question, the tariff was then well understood as a restriction of output resulting in dead-weight losses. Most conveniently, the tariff appears on a neat continuum in our consumer welfare analysis. Compared to a free-market cartel which restricts output and still manages to sustain itself against potential competitors, a tariff, which enjoys state-enforcement of output restrictions, is bound to create a clearly more objectionable interference with ‘free and full competition.’ Certainly, this was the prevailing, ‘orthodox’ view; according to mainstream economists of the day, monopoly problems ‘would arise only if such groups or classes were permitted to appropriate the political powers of the state...and create... ’artificial’ monopolies by tariff and other class legislation’” 267-268

&gt; “The evidence reveals that the Sherman Act was not part of a generally proconsumer campaign to remedy market power problems in the U.S. economy. Rather, it emerged as a political compromise with the following characteristics: (1) It provided incumbent Republican legislators (and their prevailing distributional coalition) with a cosmetic defense on the trust question, in anticipation of the upcoming consumer-to-industry transfers in the McKinley Tariff. (2) It gave advocates of small, localized firms some prospect of a buffer against the waves of creative destruction. (3) It did not augur to be a particularly consequential measure, as only twenty-two government actions were brought through 1904...(4) Hence, the prevailing distributional coalition got its legislative priority-higher tariffs-at what it took to be a good price. Populist critics of big business found it difficult to oppose the Sher- man Act, while large scale corporate interests found it unnecessary, particularly as how it bought the GOP room to maneuver o n its tariff hike.” (p.273).
