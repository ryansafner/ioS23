We discuss what determines prices in these markets, and how they vary with monopoly power and monopsony power (a buyer with market power).\n\nWe focus primarily on labor markets as the main factor market, and all of us are participants in labor markets. However, the analysis can be applied to any market for an input to production.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-dumbbell\"></i> Practice\n\nToday you will be working on practice problems:\n\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-file-pdf\"></i> Practice Problems](../files/practice/1.8-practice-pdf.pdf)\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-file-pdf\"></i> Answer Key](../files/practice/1.8-practice-answers.html)\n\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats.
