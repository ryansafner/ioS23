- Our models so far have given us interesting results

- But are **fictional**, a static picture of the world with a lot of assumptions

- But **still** show us useful insights about how a market economy works

> “It appears to be generally held that the so-called theory of 'perfect competition' provides the appropriate model for judging the effectiveness of competition in real life and that, to the extent that real competition differs from that model, it is undesirable and even harmful. For this attitude there seems to me to exist very little justification....[W]hat the theory of perfect competition discusses has little claim to be called 'competition' at all, and that its conclusions are of little use as guides to policy.”

> “[The Perfect competition model] throughout assumes that state of affairs *already to exist* which...the *process of competition* tends to *bring about* (or to approximate) and that, if the state of affairs assumed by the theory of perfect competition ever existed, it would not only deprive of their scope all the activities which the verb "to compete" describes but would make them virtually impossible. ... Advertising, undercutting, and improving ('differentiating') the goods or services produced are all excluded by definition — ‘perfect’ competition means indeed the absence of all competitive activities.”

> “When we deal, however, with a situation in which a number of persons are attempting to work out their separate plans...the problem becomes one of how the "data" of the different individuals on which they base their plans are adjusted to the objective facts of their environment (which includes the actions of the other people).”

> “Or, to anticipate our main conclusion in a brief statement, competition is by its nature a dynamic process whose essential characteristics are assumed away by the assumptions underlying static analysis [in the perfect competition model].”

> “Yet the current tendency in discussion is to be intolerant about the imperfections and to be silent about the prevention of competition. We can probably still learn more about the real significance of competition by studying the results which regularly occur where competition is deliberately suppressed than by concentrating on the shortcomings of actual competition compared with an ideal which is irrelevant for the given facts.”

> “I say advisedly ‘where competition is deliberately suppressed’ and not merely ‘where it is absent,’ because its main effects are usually operating, even if more slowly, so long as it is not outright suppressed with the assistance or the tolerance of the state.”

> “The evils which experience has shown to be the regular consequence of a suppression of competition are on a different plane from those which the imperfections of competition may cause. Much more serious than the fact that prices may not correspond to marginal cost is the fact that, with an entrenched monopoly, costs are likely to be much higher than is necessary.”

> “A monopoly based on superior efficiency, on the other hand, does comparatively little harm so long as it is assured that it will disappear as soon as anyone else becomes more efficient in providing satisfaction to the consumers.”

# Something For You To Reflect On

.pull-left[
- .hi-purple[What is “competition?”]

- Economists tend to use it as a noun — perfect competition, an end-state equilibrium
  - There’s no actual competing in perfect competition!

# So What’s the Point of the Models?

.pull-left[
- In perfect competition (model):
  - price-taking firms set price equal to marginal cost
  - long run economic profits are zero
  - allocative efficiency: consumer and producer surplus maximized

- This is a *tendency* .hi[only because of **free entry and exit**]

# So What’s the Point of the Models?

- **Don’t judge real markets by their similarity to the perfect competition model**

- Judge them more on their level of contestability, ease of potential entry

In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with  it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless..."
