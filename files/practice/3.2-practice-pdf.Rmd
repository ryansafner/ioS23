Return to the example from lessons 2.2 and 2.3: Firm 1 and Firm 2 have a constant $MC=AC=8$. The market (inverse) demand curve is given by:

$$\begin{aligned}
P&=200-2Q\\
Q&=q_1+q_2\\
\end{aligned}$$

1. Suppose Firm 1 is the Leader and Firm 2 is the follower. Find the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium quantity for each firm. Hint, the Cournot reaction functions you found before were:

$$\begin{aligned}
q_1^\star & = 48 - 0.5 * q_2\\
q_2^\star & = 48 - 0.5 * q_1\\
\end{aligned}$$

2. Find the market price.

3. Find the profit for each firm. Compare their profits under Stackelberg competition to their profits under Cournot competition (from lesson 2.2).
