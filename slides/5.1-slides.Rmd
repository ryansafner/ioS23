- Good measure of market concentration meets:

1. .hi-purple[Principle of Transfer of Sales]: a transfer of sales from a small firm to a large firm should *increase* concentration

2. .hi-purple[Entry condition]: *entry* (exit) of a small firm (holding constant the relative shares of existing firms) should *decrease* (increase) concentration

3. .hi-purple[Merger condition]: merger of 2 or more firms should *increase* concentration
  - Transfer of sales + exit of smallest firm (each raises concentration)

- An industry's .hi-purple[concentration ratio (CR)] adds the market share of the largest $n$ firms, e.g.

$$CR_n = \sum_{i=1}^n s_i$$
  - where $s_i=\frac{q_i}{Q}$, that firm's fraction of total industry sales

- Common concentration ratios: 
  - $CR_4$
  - $CR_8$

Problems with CR's:

- $n$ is arbitrarily chosen (2? 4? 8?)

- Does not follow transfer of sales principle
  - e.g. Firm 1 gaining 0.20 and Firm 3 and 4 each losing 0.10 doesn't change $CR_4$!

“The hypothetical monopolist test requires that a product market contain enough substitute products so that it could be subject to post-merger exercise of market power significantly exceeding that existing absent the merger. Specifically, the test requires that a hypothetical profit-maximizing firm, not subject to price regulation, that was the only present and future seller of those products (‘hypothetical monopolist’) likely would impose at least .hi[a small but significant and non-transitory increase in price ‘SSNIP’)] on at least one product in the market, including at least one product sold by one of the merging firms. For the purpose of analyzing this issue, the terms of sale of products outside the candidate market are held constant. The SSNIP is employed solely as a methodological tool for performing the hypothetical monopolist test; it is not a tolerance level for price increases resulting from a merger.”

# Market Definition

- Starting in 1982, Department of Justice began defining an .hi[“antitrust market”] to solve some of these problems

- Determined by a .hi-purple[“hypothetical monopolist test”]: a set of products and a geographic area where a single seller would be able to exert significant market power (raise price)

- Specifically, a .hi-purple[“small but significant and nontransitory increase in price” (SSNIP)] of 5% for 1 year

- Courts regularly talk about cross-price elasticities of demand in antitrust cases!

# The Courts on Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand

.smallest[
> “For every product substitutes exist. But a relevant market cannot meaningfully encompass that infinite a range. The circle must be drawn narrowly to exclude any other product to which, within reasonable variations in price, only a limited number of buyers will turn; in technical terms, products whose ‘cross-elasticities of demand’ are small,” *Times-Picayune Publishing v. United States*, 345 U.S. 594 at 621 n. 31 (1953)

> “Every manufacturer is the sole producer of the particular commodity it makes but its control in the above sense of the relevant market depends on the availability of alternative commodities for buyers: i.e., whether there is a cross-elasticity of demand between cellophane and the other wrappings,” *U.S. v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &. Co.*, 351 U.S. 377 (1956))

> “Cross-price elasticity is a more useful tool than own-price elasticity in defining a relevant antitrust market. Cross-price elasticity estimates tell one where the lost sales will go when the price is raised, while own-price elasticity estimates simply tell one that a price increase would cause a decline in volume,” *New York v. Kraft General Foods*, 926 F. Supp. 321 (1995)

1. Competitive firms set $\color{red}{MC_c}$ equal to new demand 2 to get $p_2$ at $q_2$

2. Cartel sets $\color{darkred}{MC_M}$ equal to new $MR_2^M$ at $q_2$, mark up to $p_2$

- Potential solution famously identified by Bresnahan (1982):

- If .hi-purple[demand *rotates*] through a price (i.e. becomes more elastic without changing equilibrium price)

1. Competitive firms don't change $p$ or $q$ $(MC_c$ still intersects Demand at same point!)

2. Cartel changes to $p_m$ and $q_m$ since $MR$ will change (and hence, intersection of $MC_m=MR)$
