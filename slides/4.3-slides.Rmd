- A contract between two parties constitutes a .hi["fundamental transformation"] from *ex ante* competitive market to an *ex post* bilateral monopoly

  - Committing a factor of production into such a relationship is a .hi-purple[specific investment], possibly .hi-purple[sunk cost]

After a specific investment is made and such quasi rents are created, the possibility of opportunistic behavior is very real.

"The manufacture of dies for stamping parts in accordance with the above specifications [for a Mustang or Ford model] gives a value to these dies specialized to Ford, which implies an appropriable quasi rent in those dies...once the large sunk fixed cost of the specific investment in the dies is made, the incentive for Ford to opportunistically renegotiate a lower price at which it will accept body parts from the independent die owner may be large. Similarly, if there is a large cost to Ford from the production delay of obtaining an alternative supplier of the specific body parts, the independent die owner may be able to capture quasi rents by demanding a revised higher price for the parts. Since the opportunity to lose the specialized quasi rent of assets is a debilitating prospect, neither party would invest in such equipment. Joint ownership of designs and dies removes this incentive to attempt appropriation," (p.308).

The demand conditions facing General Motors and Fisher Body changed dramatically over the next few years. There was a large increase in the demand for automobiles and a significant shift away from open bodies to the closed body styles supplied by Fisher. Meanwhile, General Motors was very unhappy with the price it was being charged by its now very important supplier, Fisher...By 1924, General Motors had found the Fisher contractual relationship intolerable and began negotiations for purchase of the remaining stock in Fisher Body, culminating in a final merger agreement in 1926," (pp.309-310).
