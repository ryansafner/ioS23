Then we look at Coase's key contribution - that firms exist because there are transaction costs of using markets. We wrap up with Stigler's relation of the division of labor to the life cycle of industries.\n\nFor the next few classes, we will look at other aspects of the theory of the firm, and address why firms look and behave the way they do, by understanding the economic problems that organizations try to solve.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-file-pdf\"></i> Coase (1937), \"The Nature of the Firm\"](/files/readings/Coase-1937.pdf)\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> Munger (2007), \"I'll Stick With These: Some Sharp Observations on the Division of Labor\"](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2007/Mungerpins.html)\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> Smith (1776), *Wealth of Nations*, Book I, Chs. 1-3](https://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN.html)\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-file-pdf\"></i> Stigler (1951), \"The Division of Labor is Limited by the Extent of the Market\"](/files/readings/Stigler-1951.pdf)\n\nThe free IO textbook does a good job covering the theory of the firm in Chapter 3:\n\n- <i class=\"fas fas fa-book\"></i> Ch. 3.2 in @Church^[Again, there is [a free PDF](https://works.bepress.com/jeffrey_church/23/) from the authors.]\n\nMuch of the rest of their discussion in Chapter 3 we will cover over the next few classes (asset specificity theory, vertical integration, etc.)\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats.
