.pull-left[
.smallest[

- .hi[Division of labor]: process where people *specialize* in production and then *exchange* their produce with others to acquire all of their desired goods

- Two senses: 
    1. **Factory system**: splitting up production process into specialized discrete steps boosts productivity
    2. **Economic system**: an economy of people specialize &amp; exchange for all needs, leading to widespread prosperity

Let me say that again, because it is so obvious it's confusing. .hi[As the number of potential customers you can reach expands, and the costs of shipping and handling fall, factories become fewer and larger.] There is far more capital investment in these factories, but fewer workers.

&gt; "Today, most pin manufacture has moved to Asia. Your first impulse might be to nod and think, ``Sure, cheap labor.'' But that is not an important part of the story. Pin manufacturing is highly capital intensive. Smith's insight on the division of labor, and Howe's idea of making the process continuous and making labor more productive, have combined to expand the market for Chinese pins to the whole world. The number of workers engaged in pin manufacture in China has *fallen*, not risen, as pin output has expanded. And wages have increased more than ten-fold, as productivity has exploded"

The master gun-maker–the entrepreneur–seldom possessed a factory or workshop...Usually he owned merely a warehouse in the gun quarter, and his function was to acquire semi-finished parts and to give these out to specialized craftsmen, who undertook the assembly and finishing of the gun. He purchased materials from the barrel-makers, lock-makers, sight-stampers, trigger-makers, ramrod-forgers, gun-furniture makers, and, if he were engaged in the military branch, from bayonet-forgers. All of these were independent manufacturers executing the orders of several master gunmakers...Once the parts had been purchased from the “material-makers,” as they were called, the next task was to hand them out to a long succession of “setters-up,” each of whom performed a specific operation in connection with the assembly and finishing of the gun...the jiggers...the barrel-strippers...the hardeners, polishers, borers and riflers, engravers, browners, and finally the lock-freers, who adjusted the working parts," (pp.192-193).

“It should be noted that most inventions will change both the costs of organising and the costs of using the price mechanism. In such cases, whether the invention tends to make firms larger or smaller will depend on the relative effect on these two sets of costs.  For instance, if the telephone reduces the costs of using the price mechanism more than it reduces the costs of organising, then it will have the effect of reducing the size of the firm,"

"If one considers the full life of industries...Young industries are often strangers to the established economic system. They require new kinds or qualities of materials and hence make their own; they must overcome technical problems in the use of their products and cannot wait for potential users to overcome them...These young industries must design their specialized equipment and often manufacture it, and they must undertake to recruit (historically, often to import) skilled labor. When the industry has attained a certain size and prospects, many of these tasks are sufficiently important to be turned over to specialists," (pp.190).
